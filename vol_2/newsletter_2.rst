Geany Newsletter #2

About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.


Geany Development
=================

Real-time tag parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Automatic indentation width detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geany now have the ability to detect the indentation width used by a
file when opening it, making easier to work with files using different
indentation widths. However, this auto-detection don't work (yet) if the
file uses a tabs-only indentation type.

To enable this auto-detection, go to the preferences under `Editor ->
Indentation` and check `Detect width from file`.

Fixes at template encoding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The encoding of template files is now properly auto-detected, fixing
loading of any template using an encoding incompatible with UTF-8.


Plugins
=======

Significant updates on Split Window Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geany at Chemnitzer LinuxTage (March, 19th-20th)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Together with the guys of Xfce Geany was present with a booth on
annual Chemnitzer LinuxTage in March, a convention about all topics
around Linux, BSD and free software in general. The booth was well
visited and people came not only to ask questions or report a bug
but also to tell what they are using Geany for. So Dominic, Enrico
and Frank had a lot of questions to answer and a lot of feedback to
take care about.
