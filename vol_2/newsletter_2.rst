Geany Newsletter #2
-------------------


About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.

Geany at Chemnitzer LinuxTage (March, 19th-20th)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Together with the guys of Xfce Geany was present with a booth on
annual Chemnitzer LinuxTage in March, a convention about all topics
around Linux, BSD and free software in general. The booth was well
visited and people came not only to ask questions or report a bug
but also to tell what they are using Geany for. So Dominic, Enrico
and Frank had a lot of questions to answer and a lot of feedback to
take care about.
