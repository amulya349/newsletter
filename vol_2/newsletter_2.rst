Geany at Chemnitzer LinuxTage (March, 19th-20th)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Together with the guys of Xfce Geany was present with a booth on
annual Chemnitzer LinuxTage in March, a convention about all topics
around Linux, BSD and free software in general. The booth was well
visited and people came not only to ask questions or report a bug
but also to tell what they Geany are using for. So Dominic, Enrico
and Frank had a lot of question to answer and a lot of feedback to
take care about.
