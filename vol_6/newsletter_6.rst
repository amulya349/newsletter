About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.

Notes from the plugin section.


New Plugins
***********

Commander
^^^^^^^^^

Markdown
^^^^^^^^

The Markdown-plugin is providing a real-time preview of rendered Markdown.
For doing this, it's, converted to HTML, inserted into an HTML template
and loaded into a WebKit view. While doing this, the main features of the
plugin are:

* Allows placing the preview in the sidebar or message window areas
* Updates the preview on-the-fly as you type, automatically.
* Allows simple customization of fonts and colours and complete control
  with custom template files.


Geany mailing lists have been moved and renamed
===============================================

After we have moved most of the self-hosted Geany infrastructure to a new server
dedicated to Geany only earlier this year, the last missing bit were the mailing
lists which were still running on uvena.de and not geany.org.
Now the lists are also moved to geany.org and now have a nice domain part:
@lists.geany.org. And while changing the domain part of the list addresses,
we also renamed some of the lists. Most lists got their "geany-" prefix removed
as this not necessary anymore with a geany.org domain name. But more important,
the main Geany mailing list has been renamed from geany@uvena.de to
users@lists.geany.org.

Please update your mail client accordingly if necessary.
However, for convenience the old list addresses will continue to work.

An overview of the available mailing lists can be found on
http://www.geany.org/Support/MailingList.
