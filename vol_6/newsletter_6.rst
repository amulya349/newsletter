About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.

Commander

Markdown
^^^^^^^^

The Markdown-plugi is providing a real-time preview of rendered Markdown.
For doing this, it's, converted to HTML, inserted into an HTML template 
and loaded into a WebKit view. While doing this, the main features of the
plugin are:

* Allows placing the preview in the sidebar or message window areas
* Updates the preview on-the-fly as you type, automatically.
* Allows simple customization of fonts and colours and complete control
  with custom template files.
