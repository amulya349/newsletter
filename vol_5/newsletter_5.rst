About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.



New translations and updates
============================

Since our last newsletter a number of translations has been updated
or newly added to Geany. New translations are:

* Arabian
* Indonesian
* Lithuanian
* Mongolian (back in 2011)

But also translations like German, Kazakh, Hungarian, Italian,
Traditional Chinese and Swedish translations have been updated
during the last roughly four month.


Wiki available
==============

We set up a wiki for additional documentation and resources related 
to Geany at http://wiki.geany.org. Anyone can contribute to the wiki 
simply by registering and then logging in.

In the wiki you can find configuration snippets and tips, snippets for
various programming languages and many additional tags files to enhance
Geany's autocompletion features.

Everybody is welcome to add additional useful content to the wiki.


C++ plugins supported
=====================

Geany's public plugin API headers have been updated to support 
inclusion into C++ code. Most of the changes involve adding `extern 
"C" {...}` blocks around the public headers' code (by way of GLIB's 
`G_BEGIN_DECLS` and `G_END_DECLS` macros) to make them easier to 
include, so the C++ code doesn't need to do this.

You can now write plugins in C++ and they will be loadable by Geany 
at run-time. Of course using Geany's API will still involve using C 
in your code, but the rest of your plugin can use whatever C++ 
features you want. You can even use gtkmm [1] in your plugin if you 
want.

Any of the symbols Geany looks up at run-time must not have their 
names mangled by the compiler. To avoid this, put that code inside 
an `extern "C"` block.

Here's an example of Geany's Hello World plugin from the Plugin 
HowTo [2] ported to C++::

	#include <geanyplugin.h>

	class HelloWorld
	{
		private:
			gchar *hello_message;
			GtkWidget *main_menu_item;

		public:
			HelloWorld(const gchar *message);
			~HelloWorld();
			void SayHelloWorld();
	};

	static HelloWorld *hello;

	extern "C"
	{
		GeanyPlugin     *geany_plugin;
		GeanyData       *geany_data;
		GeanyFunctions  *geany_functions;

		PLUGIN_VERSION_CHECK(211)
		PLUGIN_SET_INFO("HelloWorld C++",
						"Just another tool to say hello world, this time in C++",
						"1.0", "John Doe <john.doe@example.org>");

		void plugin_init(GeanyData *data)
		{
			hello = new HelloWorld("Hello C++ World");
		}

		void plugin_cleanup(void)
		{
			delete hello;
		}

		static void on_menu_item_clicked(GtkMenuItem *item, gpointer user_data)
		{
			hello->SayHelloWorld();
		}
	}

	HelloWorld::HelloWorld(const gchar *message)
	{
		hello_message = g_strdup(message);
		main_menu_item = gtk_menu_item_new_with_mnemonic("Hello World");
		gtk_widget_show(main_menu_item);
		gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(geany->main_widgets->tools_menu), main_menu_item);
		g_signal_connect(main_menu_item, "activate", G_CALLBACK(on_menu_item_clicked), NULL);
	}

	HelloWorld::~HelloWorld()
	{
		g_free(hello_message);
		gtk_widget_destroy(main_menu_item);
	}

	void HelloWorld::SayHelloWorld()
	{
		dialogs_show_msgbox(GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, "%s", hello_message);
	}

It's important to note that the dynamic library loading mechanism 
that loads plugins is C functionality and does not know about C++ 
constructors. This means that global and static objects in the 
plugin will *not* have their constructors called when the plugin is 
loaded. Use dynamically created objects as show in the above example.

These changes will be available in the next Geany release but you 
can start using them right away in your C++ plugins if you Build 
Geany From Git [3].

Plugins
=======

Notes from the plugin section. 


New Plugins
***********

GeanyPyflakes
#############

Pyflakes is a command line tool that statically analyzes python 
program and detects two kinds of errors: unused imports and 
undefined symbols. geany-pyflakes runs pyflakes in the background 
and parses its output. Afterwards puts markers on lines with errors 
and adds the output to the panel at the bottom of editor (the one 
with console, todo, etc.). Geany-pyflakes is available at its project 
pages at http://code.google.com/p/geany-pyflakes/

Another way to check your Python code is described inside the wiki at 
http://wiki.geany.org/howtos/check_python_code


GeniusPaste
###########

GeniusPaste is a plugin which is adding the possibility to paste 
your code from Geany into different pastebins. It supports this 
services:

 * codepad.org
 * pastebin.com
 * pastebin.geany.org
 * dpaste.de
 * sprunge.us

During the paste process GeniusPaste detects automatically the 
syntax of your code and paste it with syntax highlighting enabled. 
Once this is done it is also able to redirect you to the pasted code 
opening a new browser tab.


GeanyPG
*******

GeanyPG is a plugin that allows the user to encrypt, decrypt text
and verify signatures with GnuPG from inside Geany. It's created by
Hans Alves and is part of the geany-plugins project.

After the plugin has been installed successfully, it can be loaded
from inside Geany's plugin manager which will add a new menu item
into the Tools menu offering functions of the plugin.

To decrypt or encrypt, just select the interesting parts and choose
the function you wish -- If none text has been selected, the whole
document will be processed. In case you like to verify a signature
obviously you will have to select the whole block.

When encrypting a message you can choose to sign at the same time.
If a passphrase is needed, the GPGME library will decide how the
user is prompted. Usually this will use gpg-agent. If gpg-agent is
disabled, pinentry with one of its frontends will be used.


Geany local
===========

Geany at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 (March 17th, 18th)
*****************************************************

As last year, Geany had a booth a Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 in
German city Chemnitz. Our booth was again located next to the guys
of Xfce as well as next (that was different to last year) to 2
lecture rooms. Even though the event wasn't as much crowded as last
year, a lot of people were passing by asking some question or just
saying hello. So Enrico and Frank had a lot of questions to answer
and a lot of feedback to respond to.



Geany Packages for Fedora
=========================

There are new packages unofficially available for Fedora. One is 
containing the Geany Themes Matthew maintains at GitHub [1], the 
other one provides the tags files listed in the Geany Wiki [2]. The 
packages are not yet in Fedoras official repositories but available 
at Dominic's Fedora People space [3]. Note the geany-themes package 
is intended to work with current Git versions of Geany only. A 
x86_64 package from the current Git master as well as an SRPM for 
rebuilding is also available at [3].

The geany-tags package is split into subpackages containing the tags 
for each programming language. Currently these are: geany-tags-c, 
geany-tags-php and geany-tags-python. They can be installed 
independently from each other, of course.

Contact Dominic if you have suggestions for improvements.
