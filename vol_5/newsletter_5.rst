But also translations like German, Kazakh, Hungarian, Traditional Chinese and
Swedish translations have been updated during the last roughly three
month.


Wiki available
==============

We set up a wiki for additional documentation and resources related to Geany
at http://wiki.geany.org. Anyone can contribute to the wiki simply by
registering and then logging in.

In the wiki you can find configuration snippets and tips, snippets for
various programming languages and many additional tags files to enhance
Geany's autocompletion features.

Everybody is welcome to add additional useful content to the wiki.

Geany at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 (March 17th, 18th)
*****************************************************

As last year, Geany had a booth a Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 in
German city Chemnitz. Our booth was again located next to the guys
of Xfce as well as next (that was different to last year) to 2
lecture rooms. Even though the event wasn't as much crowded as last
year, a lot of people were passing by asking some question or just
saying hello. So Enrico and Frank had a lot of questions to answer
and a lot of feedback to respond to.



Geany Packages
==============

There are new packages unofficially available for Fedora. One is containing
the Geany Themes Matthew maintains at GitHub [1], the other one provides the
tags files listed in the Geany Wiki [2]. The packages are not yet in Fedoras
official repositories but available at Dominic's Fedora People space [3].
Note the geany-themes package is intended to work with current Git versions
of Geany only. A x86_64 package from the current Git master as well as an
SRPM for rebuilding is also available at [3].

The geany-tags package is split into subpackages containing the tags for
each programming language. Currently these are: geany-tags-c, geany-tags-php
and geany-tags-python. They can be installed independently from each other,
of course.

Contact Dominic if you have suggestions for improvements.

About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.
