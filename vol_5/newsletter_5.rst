Geany at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 (March 17th, 18th)
*****************************************************

As known from the last years, in March (17th, 18th) there will be a
local Linux and FOSS convention in Chemnitz, Germany. Some of the
Geany guys will be around and have a little booth at the event. So
if you are nearby, come join us for a chat. Most likely you will
find us next to the Xfce guys. Details for this convention can be
find on their homepage at http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2012/

About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.
