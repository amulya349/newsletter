Geany Newsletter #5

.. contents::


Wiki available
==============

We set up a wiki for additional documentation and resources related to Geany
at http://wiki.geany.org. Anyone can contribute to the wiki simply by
registering and then logging in.

In the wiki you can find configuration snippets and tips, snippets for
various programming languages and many additional tags files to enhance
Geany's autocompletion features.

Everybody is welcome to add additional useful content to the wiki.


Geany local
===========

Geany at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2012 (March 17th, 18th)
*****************************************************

As known from the last years, in March (17th, 18th) there will be a local
Linux and FOSS convention in Chemnitz, Germany. Some of the Geany guys will
be around and have a little booth at the event. So if you are nearby, come
join us for a chat. Most likely you will find us next to the Xfce guys.
Details for this convention can be find on their homepage at
http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2012/


Geany Packages
==============

There are new packages unofficially available for Fedora. One is containing
the Geany Themes Matthew maintains at GitHub [1], the other one provides the
tags files listed in the Geany Wiki [2]. The packages are not yet in Fedoras
official repositories but available at Dominic's Fedora People space [3].
Note the geany-themes package is intended to work with current Git versions
of Geany only. A x86_64 package from the current Git master as well as an
SRPM for rebuilding is also available at [3].

The geany-tags package is split into subpackages containing the tags for
each programming language. Currently these are: geany-tags-c,
geany-tags-php, geany-tags-php and geany-tags-python. They can be installed
independently from each other, of course.

Contact Dominic if you have suggestions for improvements.

About Geany
===========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a
few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE
or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.

More information about Geany can be found at
`geany.org <http://www.geany.org/>`_.
