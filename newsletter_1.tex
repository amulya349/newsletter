\section{Geany 0.20 has been released}

On January, 6th version 0.20 of Geany "Disra" has been released. As always
the release containing a number of bug fixes as well as
improvements/new features.

Some of the highlights:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve compatibility with GVFS using GIO to save documents (Alexey Antipov).
	\item Fix sometimes crashing when closing a modified document and choosing Save.
	\item Reorganise Find in Files dialog and add Files pattern to filter search results.
	\item Show mimetype icon in sidebar Documents list and notebook popup menu (Colomban Wendling).
	\item Add per-document indent width setting (Jiří Techet).
	\item Fix passing quoted arguments when using 'Send Selection to'. This means e.g. sed 's/\textbackslash{}./(dot)/g' now works.
	\item Add alternative color scheme based on Python colors (View->Editor->Color Schemes - not all filetypes supported yet).
	\item Auto-indent after an HTML/XML line without a closing tag (Eugene Arshinov).
	\item Add Forth filetype (Thomas Huth).
	\item Add Lisp filetype (Mário Silva).
	\item Add Erlang filetype (Taylor Venable).
	\item Add translations: kk.
	\item Update translations: cs, de, en\_GB, es, fi, fr, hu, ja, nl, pt, sl, sv, tr, zh\_CN.
\end{itemize}
