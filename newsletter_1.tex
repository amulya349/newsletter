\section{Geany 0.20 has been released}

On January, 6th version 0.20 of Geany "Disra" has been released. As always

\section{Geany-Plugins 0.20 have been released}

Short after release of Geany also the plugins collection

This release has been done after about 6 month of developing work
and is collecting a number of changes.

\subsection{New plugins}
\subsubsection{UpdateChecker}

\subsubsection{WebHelper}

\textbf{WebHelper} is a plugin for Geany that provides some web
development facilities, such as a web page preview and some
debugging tools (web inspector). To do so the plugin is implementing
a couple of features:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A basic web view, allowing to display any web page (using WebKit);
	\item Possible automatic reloading of the web view upon document saving;
	\item A web inspector/debugging tool for the web view's content (including a
		JavaScript console, a viewer and editor of processed HTML and CSS, a network
		usage analysis tool and many more, thanks to WebKit).
\end{itemize}

updated Scintilla has been merged from unstable branch into trunk.

\subsection{Further patches}

\section{Plugins}

It was a quiet active time right after the 0.20 release on plugin
development side.

\subsection{New plugins to Geany-Plugins-project}
\subsubsection{Tableconvert}

After a little chaos with naming of plugin the new plugin \texttt{Tableconvert}
has been added to the development version of the Geany-Plugins. Its
offering a way to convert tabulator separated lists as e.g. imported
from Microsoft Excel or Libreoffice Calc into a table. Currently the
plugin is supporting HTML and \LaTeX{} for doing this.

\subsubsection{Debugger}

With \texttt{Debugger} it has been added a second binding to gdb to
the Geany-Plugins project.
