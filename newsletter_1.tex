\section*{Editorial}

Welcome to the first Geany newsletter with highlights of the last few weeks
during Geany development and use. This newsletter is not intended to give a complete
overview of Geany news, but is trying to collect the most important items.
Have fun and happy coding!


\section{Geany 0.20 has been released}

On January, 6th version 0.20 of Geany "Disra" was released. As always
the release containing a number of bug fixes as well as
improvements and new features.

\section{Geany-Plugins 0.20 have been released}

Shortly after the release of Geany the Geany-Plugins collection
was released with version 0.20. This collection
includes a number of useful plugins, not shipped with Geany itself.
This release is the result of about 6 months of development work
and so it has quite a number of changes and some new plugins:

\subsection{New plugins}

\textbf{WebHelper} is a plugin that provides some web
development facilities, such as a web page preview and some
debugging tools (web inspector). The plugin is implements
the following features:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A basic web view, allowing the display of any web page (using WebKit);
	\item Possible automatic reloading of the web view upon document saving;

		JavaScript console, a viewer and editor of processed HTML and CSS, a network
		usage analysis tool and many more, thanks to WebKit).

\section{Geany-Development}

After the 0.20 release the development has been a bit slowed down. But
nevertheless, some changes did happen:

\subsection{Update to Scintilla 2.22}

Right after the release of Geany 0.20 with Subversion r5521 a
updated version of Scintilla has been merged from unstable branch
into trunk. Geany trunk is now running with version 2.22 of
Scintilla editing component.

\subsection{Further patches}
\subsubsection{Support for COBOL}

At end of January a patch has been committed to Geany trunk which is
enabling COBOL-support inside Geany. Now its also possible to use
features like syntax highlighting for this language.


\section{Plugins}

It was a quiet active time right after the 0.20 release on plugin
development side.

\subsection{New plugins to Geany-Plugins-project}
\subsubsection{Tableconvert}

After a little chaos with naming, the new plugin \texttt{Tableconvert}
has been added to the development version of the Geany-Plugins. Its
offering a way to convert tab separated lists (e.g. imported
from Microsoft Excel or Libreoffice Calc) into a table. Currently the
plugin is supporting HTML and \LaTeX{} tables.

\subsubsection{Debugger}

The \texttt{Debugger} plugin has added a second binding for gdb to
the Geany-Plugins project.
